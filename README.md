Projects initial purpose is to be able to automate completion of check list items.

Please note that to use this module is not Core OS friendly, and you will at some point need access to a browser to get your tokens.

The token can be set to never expire, or you will need IE to interactively retrieve it from the Get-TAuthToken cmdlet.
